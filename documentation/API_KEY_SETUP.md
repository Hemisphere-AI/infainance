# OpenAI API Key Setup

## ðŸ”‘ Quick Setup

Your LLM integration test shows that the tools are working perfectly, but you need to configure your OpenAI API key to enable the chat functionality.

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Add to Your .env File

Open the `.env` file in your project root and replace the placeholder:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server

The server should restart automatically when you save the `.env` file. If not, restart manually:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Again

Click the "Test LLM Integration" button again. You should now see:

```
âœ… All tests completed successfully!
ðŸŽ‰ LLM integration is working perfectly!
```

## ðŸ’¡ What's Working

âœ… **Tool Integration**: All spreadsheet tools (find, read, update, recalc) are working  
âœ… **Layout**: Chat interface is properly positioned and responsive  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation  
âœ… **UI**: Modern chat interface with message history  

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use

Once you add your API key, you can:

- **Upload an Excel file** to the app
- **Chat with the AI** about your spreadsheet data
- **Ask "what if" questions** like "What if my interest rate was twice as high?"
- **Modify data** through natural language commands

The AI will automatically use the appropriate tools to interact with your spreadsheet data in real-time!

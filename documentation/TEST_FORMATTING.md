# Testing Excel Formatting Extraction

## How to Test

1. **Create a test Excel file** with the following formatting:
   - **Date cells**: Format some cells as dates (mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, etc.)
   - **Currency cells**: Format some cells as currency ($1,234.56)
   - **Percentage cells**: Format some cells as percentages (15.5%)
   - **Number cells**: Format some cells with specific decimal places

2. **Upload the file** to the application

3. **Check the browser console** for debug information:
   - Look for "Cell formats extracted: X rows with formatting"
   - Look for "Formatting examples:" - this shows what formats were detected
   - Look for "Sample cells with formatting:" - this shows the cell structure
   - Look for "Formatting cell:" - this shows formatting being applied during display

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix (What you were seeing):
- Dates displayed as numbers (e.g., 44927 instead of 12/25/2023)
- Currency displayed as plain numbers (e.g., 1234.56 instead of $1,234.56)
- Percentages displayed as decimals (e.g., 0.155 instead of 15.5%)

### After Fix (What you should see now):
- Dates displayed in proper format (e.g., 12/25/2023)
- Currency displayed with $ symbol and commas (e.g., $1,234.56)
- Percentages displayed with % symbol (e.g., 15.5%)
- Numbers with proper decimal places

## Debug Information

When you upload an Excel file, you should see console output like:

```
Cell formats extracted: 5 rows with formatting
Formatting examples: [
  {
    position: "R1C1",
    format: "mm/dd/yyyy",
    type: "d",
    value: 44927,
    cellInfo: { ... }
  },
  {
    position: "R1C2", 
    format: "$#,##0.00",
    type: "n",
    value: 1234.56,
    cellInfo: { ... }
  }
]
Sample cells with formatting:
Cell R1C1: {
  value: "44927",
  rawValue: 44927,
  numberFormat: "mm/dd/yyyy",
  cellType: "date",
  isDate: true,
  decimalPlaces: null
}
Formatting cell: {
  value: "44927",
  rawValue: 44927,
  numberFormat: "mm/dd/yyyy",
  cellType: "date",
  isDate: true,
  decimalPlaces: null
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If formatting is still not working:

1. **Check console for errors** - Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify format detection** - Check if "Cell formats extracted" shows > 0
3. **Check format examples** - Verify that numberFormat values are being detected
4. **Look for formatting cell logs** - These show when formatting is being applied

## Common Issues

1. **No formatting detected**: The Excel file might not have explicit formatting
2. **Raw values not preserved**: Check if rawValue is different from value
3. **Format strings not recognized**: Some Excel formats might not be supported yet

## Supported Formats

- **Dates**: mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd, h:mm, hh:mm
- **Currency**: $#,##0.00, $#,##0
- **Percentage**: 0.00%, 0%
- **Numbers**: #,##0.00, 0.00, #,##0

If you're still seeing raw values instead of formatted values, please share the console output so I can help debug the issue!

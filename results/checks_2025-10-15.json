This ensures that expenses are recognized promptly, which is crucial for accurate financial reporting and cash flow management.\n\n### Compliance Risk\n- **Risk Level: Low**: Since there are no draft vendor bills, there is minimal risk of non-compliance with accounting standards related to expense recognition.
